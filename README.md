# Terraform containerised lambda builder
Trying to use docker with terraform to simplify build steps for deployment where multiple runtimes are required to build lambda packages.
This is a work in progress. Have plans to turn this into a terraform module where you pass in the folder path and build args and it gives you back a zip as a data object maybe?
Anyway, Try it, add to it, remove from it. No probs.
